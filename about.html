            <h2>How did we get here?</h2>
            <p>Pro Nails began its journey in the early 2000s in Staunton, Virginia. The salon was born from a shared passion for beauty and creating a sanctuary where clients could feel their most 
                confident. With unwavering years of hard work, the founders poured their hearts into building Pro Nails from the ground up.</p>
            <p>Through years of hard work and a deep connection to their community, they were able to open a new location in Waynesboro, Virginia. For nearly a decade, this vibrant space has been the 
                heart of Pro Nails, welcoming clients to indulge in luxurious treatments and unparalleled care. </p>
